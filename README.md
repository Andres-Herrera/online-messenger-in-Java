This is the final project for the module of Advanced programming at the University of East London.

the .jar files are the executable files (Server and Client) and the zipped folder contains all the code for all the classes implemented in the project.  The readme.txt provides firther information about the application

This is an application that allows multiple users to char via text with other users in the network.
It uses Threads to allow for multiple connections and also uses a Client- Server infrastructure.

The applcation is devided in 2 main parts, the Server and the Client.

For the application to function, one computer needs to acts as the server and share the ip addres with the rest of the users in order to connect.
The application also uses the functionality of a data base to store the user names and passwords.  We use the open source H2 dabase facilities for this scope.
It also uses encryption for safeguard the passwords of the created users.
